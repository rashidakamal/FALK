# Fully-Automated Luxury Kitchen

It's a dream. 

Personal set of tools for kitchen, pantry, and recipe management. 

I'm using this as an experiment to help me cook yummy recipes from my at-home cookbooks and a few online blogs I follow, as well as be more conscious of meal planning and prepping as a way of reducing food waste in my household. 

I will make no attempt to automate the cooking itself â€“ that is the fun part! This projects exists solely to get me to the fun part with greater ease. 

On the technical side, I will be practicing working with React and building my own React components.

I'll be adding some of my notes and the resources I find to this page.
